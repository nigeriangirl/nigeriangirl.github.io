When I was in highschool I used to be part of an online community called SecondLife. Maybe you have heard of it. Maybe you haven't. I started an online furniture store and did quite well while I was in school. Until Second Life decided to incorporate the use of "mesh" which had to be created on programs like Bender(very steep learning curve) or Maya which was expensive and I at the time did not have the type of computer to run such a high end program.

Anyways needless to say, my business soon died...and I stepped away from the computer. When I got into college my love for computers was re-ignited. Going to a school that I thought lacked in the proper websites/apps required to streamline information for college students I started learning HTML/CSS on my own. I quickly figured out it takes a hell of a lot more to make a dynamic website. I started researching the languages I would need to know in order to be able to create something so beautiful.

Words that were foreign to me like Backbone...what the hell is that? Javascript...is that a type of coffee? Ruby on Rails...are we selling jewelry now? I started looking at what kind of jobs were available to developers and what they could build. I swear I thought LAMP meant that developers were hands on...I swear.

It wasn't until I graduated from the University of Hawaii...an optimistic fresh faced college grad who thought that I would just walk in and get at least 60k starting in salary...HAHA oh how wrong I was. The science/research field is a terribly paid field....you don't enter it for money that's for sure. It wasn't something I was passionate about from the beginning anyways so I didn't see the point of continuing down the path of academia. I realized I should of done what I wanted to do since high school and become a web developer. That's why I'm here.
