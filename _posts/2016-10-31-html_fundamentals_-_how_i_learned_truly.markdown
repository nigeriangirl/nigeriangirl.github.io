I'm the type of person that needs to be able to see what it is that I'm doing and how what I'm writing changes the look. 

HTML or Hypertext Markup Language was on of the first things I learned how to read and write years ago. What helped me? Adobe Dreamweaver. Yes yes I know it's important that we should all know how to code HTML without the assistance of programs but being able to see visually in real time with HTML and CSS allowed me to understand the need of classes, id, parents and children.

I will say as I have learned more about web development I find myself liking frameworks and back-end development more than I like front-end. I like learning more about how to make a site do something...than how it looks. Well as I continue to learn I hope to get to the point where I can be proficient at both before diving in deeper!
