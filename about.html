<p>I went to school at University of Hawaii at Manoa for Molecular Biology & Cellular Genetics. After graduating I thought I would be entering to a solid job market....oh how wrong I was. Realizing that I had just been in school for 5 years to get paid $12 an hour is really depressing. I decided to make the decision to learn Web Development and hopefully hone in and build a portfolio.</p>
